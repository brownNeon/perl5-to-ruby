== KNOWN TO BE BROKEN

* BEGIN { } block output is not formatted correctly
* single-line if statements are broke
* while (<X>) {} file iteration
* print $FH "string"
* c-style for-loops (for ($x=1;$x<100;$x++) {})

== MISC TODO

semicolon removal at line-end only works in a few specific cases right now

pre-replace this:
   moose ('bar', 'baz');
with this, like perltidy:
   moose('bar', 'baz');

The fat comma operator (=>) also automatically quotes any bareword used as its left operand (Hashes).

replace this:
 %a = ( BAZ => "bar") ;
with this:
 %a = ( 'BAZ' => "bar") ;
